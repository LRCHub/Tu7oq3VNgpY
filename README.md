[00:31.80] Remember when you were young? (Ha-ha-ha-ha)
[08:51.38] You shone like the sun
[09:02.38] 
[08:53.77] Shine on, you crazy diamond
[09:07.27] 
[09:04.42] Now there's a look in your eyes
[09:10.23] Like black holes in the sky
[09:23.73] 
[09:14.72] Shine on, you crazy diamond
[09:28.22] 
[09:24.51] You were caught in the crossfire
[09:28.09] Of childhood and stardom
[09:30.62] Blown on the steel breeze
[09:35.83] Come on, you target for faraway laughter
[09:41.27] Come on, you stranger
[09:43.85] You legend, you martyr, and shine
[10:00.35] 
[10:07.72] You reached for the secret too soon
[10:13.82] You cried for the moon
[10:24.82] 
[10:17.88] Shine on, you crazy diamond
[10:31.38] 
[10:28.29] Threatened by shadows at night
[10:34.10] And exposed in the light
[10:46.10] 
[10:38.53] Shine on, you crazy diamond
[10:52.03] 
[10:48.36] Well, you wore out your welcome
[10:51.66] With random precision
[10:54.19] Rode on the steel breeze
[10:59.32] Come on, you raver, you seer of visions
[11:04.68] Come on, you painter
[11:07.28] You piper, you prisoner, and shine
